## Wallet SDK 🚀

The =nil; Wallet Extension comes with a built-in SDK that follows the [EIP-1193 Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193)

We are also actively working on supporting the [EIP-6963 Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963) to further improve multi-provider support.

The extension injects the `window.nil` object into the browser. Currently, we support the following two methods:

1. **eth_sendTransaction:** Send transactions directly from the wallet.
2. **eth_requestAccounts:** Request user wallet addresses.

To learn more about how to use the SDK, visit the [SDK Documentation](#)
