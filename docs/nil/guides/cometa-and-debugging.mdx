# Debugging smart contracts

=nil; comes equipped with the Cometa service which is a tool for storing contract metadata and analyzing transactions. If a transaction fails due to a bug in contract logic, Cometa can pinpoint the exact line of Solidity code where the issue that caused the failure has occurred.

Working with the Cometa service involves these steps:

* Creating a JSON file with the description of the compilation task
* Compiling the contract and deploying it
* Registering the contract with the Cometa service
* Using the =nil; developer tools to investigate any failed transactions to the contract

:::tip[Playground integration]

Whenever a contract is deployed via [**the =nil; Playground**](https://explore.nil.foundation/sandbox), it is automatically registered inside the Cometa service.

## Draft an example contract

To illustrate how debugging works, this tutorial uses the following contract:

```solidity showLineNumbers file=../../tests/CounterBug.sol start=startContract end=endContract
```

Inside the `increment()` function, the contract has a `require()` statement with a condition that will never evaluate to `true` unless the contract is called from the zero address. This is done to deliberately trigger an `ExecutionReverted` error.

## Create a file with the compilation task

As input, Cometa takes a JSON file storing a compilation task. This task includes the compiler version, settings, and the contract files to be compiled.

See the below example on how this file should be structured:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "contractName": "CounterBug.sol:CounterBug",
  "compilerVersion": "0.8.28",
  "settings": {
    "evmVersion": "shanghai",
    "optimizer": {
      "enabled": false,
      "runs": 200
    }
  },
  "sources": {
    "CounterBug.sol": {
      "urls": ["./CounterBug.sol"]
    }

  }
}
```

:::tip

Make sure that the compiler version in the input file is compatible with the specified EVM target.

:::

Note that the `"sources"` key must contain all `.sol` files used during contract compilation including any imported contracts.

For locally imported contracts:

```json showLineNumbers
"sources": {
    "CounterBug.sol": {
      "urls": ["./CounterBug.sol"]
    },
    "Nil.sol": {
      "urls": ["path/to/Nil.sol"]
    }
  }
```

For contracts imported from packages:

```json showLineNumbers
"sources": {
    "CounterBug.sol": {
      "urls": ["./CounterBug.sol"]
    },
    "@nilfoundation/smart-contracts/Nil.sol": {
      "urls": ["path/to/Nil.sol"]
    }
  }
```

## Compile the contract, deploy it, and register it

### Via the =nil; CLI

To compile the contract, deploy it and register it inside Cometa:

```bash file=../../tests/commands.mjs start=startCometaCommand end=endCometaCommand
```

Alternatively, compile the contract:

```bash file=../../tests/compilationCommands.js start=startCounterBugCompilationCommand end=endCounterBugCompilationCommand
```

Deploy the contract separately:

```bash file=../../tests/commands.mjs start=startCounterBugDeploymentCommand end=endCounterBugDeploymentCommand
```

Register the contract with the Cometa service:

```bash file=../../tests/cometa-and-debugging.test.mts start=startCounterBugRegistrationCommand end=endCounterBugRegistrationCommand
```

### Via Nil.js

To compile the contract, deploy it and register it inside Cometa:

```typescript showLineNumbers file=../../tests/cometa-and-debugging.test.mts start=startNilJSImport end=endNilJSImport
```

```typescript showLineNumbers file=../../tests/cometa-and-debugging.test.mts start=startNilJSCometaTutorialSnippet end=endNilJSCometaTutorialSnippet
```

## Investigate failed transactions to the contract

### Via the =nil; CLI

To send a transaction to the `increment()` function of the contract:

```bash file=../../tests/cometa-and-debugging.test.mts start=startCounterBugIncrementCommand end=endCounterBugIncrementCommand
```

The command will produce the hash of the failed transaction to the contract. To investigate this transaction:

```bash file=../../tests/cometa-and-debugging.test.mts start=startDebugCommand end=endDebugCommand
```

The output of the command should contain the entire transaction chain as well as the exact line where execution was reverted:

```solidity showLineNumbers
require(msg.sender == address(0));
```

### Via Nil.js

`Nil.js` currently does not support the debug API for Cometa.
