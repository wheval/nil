# `Nil.js`: reading and writing info

The `Nil.js` client library provides several 'helper' methods for reading and writing to =nil;

To retrieve the block with the given hash:

```typescript showLineNumbers
import { PublicClient } from '@nilfoundation/niljs';

const client = new PublicClient({
    transport: new HttpTransport({
        endpoint: "{NIL_ENDPOINT}",
    }),
    shardId: 1,
});
const block = await client.getBlockByHash(BLOCK_HASH);
```

To call an existing smart contract after [**initializing a smart account**](./creating-smart-account.mdx):

```typescript showLineNumbers
import {
  encodeFunctionData,
  type Abi,
} from "viem";

const data = encodeFunctionData({
    abi: CONTRACT_ABI as Abi,
    functionName: "{funcName}",
    args: [],
    }
);

const transactionHash = await smartAccount.sendTransaction({
    to: '{CONTRACT_ADDRESS}',
    data: data,
    value: 100_000n,
    feeCredit: 1_000_000n
});

await waitTillCompleted(client, transactionHash);
```

:::tip

The `waitTillCompleted()` function enforces waiting for the results of the execution of the transaction whose hash is passed as an argument. It is crucial for avoiding null-type errors.

:::

To read information about the resulting transaction:

```typescript
const transaction = await client.getTransactionByHash(transactionHash);
```

To read the transaction receipt:


```typescript
const receipt = await client.getTransactionReceiptByHash(transactionHash);
```
