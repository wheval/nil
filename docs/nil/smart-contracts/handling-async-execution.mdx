# Handling async execution

To support [**cross-shard communication**](../architecture/sharding.mdx#cross-shard-communication), =nil; supports smart contracts making async calls to one another directly in Solidity code.

## Performing an async call

Consider a smart contract with the following code:

```sol showLineNumbers file=../../tests/CallerAsyncBasicPattern.sol start=startCallerAsyncBasicPattern end=endCallerAsyncBasicPattern
```

<PGButton name="CallerAsyncBasicPattern.sol"/>

The `asyncCall()` function makes it possible for the contract to call a function in another smart contract regardless of the shard where this contract is located. There are no additional actions required for making async calls: simply adding `asyncCall()` and specifying its arguments is sufficient.

:::info

The `asyncCall()` function is a shortcut for executing a precompiled contract responsible for managing async calls across the cluster.

:::

:::tip

To initiate an async call, the 'caller' contract must have sufficient funds to pay for initiating a new transaction.

:::

:::info[Async calls on the same shard]

`asyncCall()` works even if the contract with the specified address is located on the same shard. The mechanism remains exactly the same as with cross-shard communications: the function will produce a new transaction, and the requested function in another contract will be executed whenever said transaction is processed by the shard. This usually occurs within the space of two-three blocks.

:::

## Examples

Consider two contracts deployed on two different shards in =nil;:

* Contract 1 (caller) is deployed on Shard 1
* Contract 2 (receiver) is deployed on Shard 2

There are two possible patterns for cross-shard communication between Contract 1 and Contract 2.

### Calling a contract on another shard

In this pattern, Contract 1 simply calls a function in Contract 2 without receiving a result.

Contract 1 has the following structure:

```solidity showLineNumbers file=../../tests/Caller.sol start=startContract end=endContract
```

<PGButton name="CallerCounter.sol"/>

Contract 2 is [**the`Counter` contract**](../nil-101.mdx#flow-1).

Whenever the `call()` function is called inside Contract 1, a new outgoing transaction is spawned. When Shard 2 picks up this transaction and processes it, Contract 2 calls its `increment()` function. After `getValue()` is called, the result should display the total number of times the `call()` function was executed by Contract 1.

### Callback pattern

In this pattern, Contract 1 defines a special callback function and then uses the `sendRequest()` method to perform an async request to another shard. Whenever the request executes, a response transaction is sent back to the caller. The callback function is then executed and the response value can be retrieved via the `responseData` argument.

:::info

As its third argument, `sendRequest()` accepts the amount of gas that will be reserved instantly and will later be used to process the execution of the callback function.

:::

Contract 1 acts as a simple escrow mechanism. The `submitForVerification()` function accepts the address of the validator and the addresses of the escrow participants. The function then sends a request to the validator while assigning `resolve()` as the callback. Whenever the validator processes the request, Contract 1 can retrieve the returned data.

```solidity showLineNumbers file=../../tests/Escrow.sol start=startEscrow end=endEscrow
```

<PGButton name="EscrowValidator.sol"/>

Contract 2 acts as the validator for escrow resolution:

```solidity showLineNumbers file=../../tests/Validator.sol start=startValidator end=endValidator
```

<PGButton name="EscrowValidator.sol"/>
