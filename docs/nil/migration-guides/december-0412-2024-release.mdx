# Release 04.12.2024: migration guide

This release of =nil; fixes several issues with the =nil; CLI and adds quality-of-life improvements to `Nil.js`.

## Summary of key changes

### General changes

* The [**Cometa service**](../guides/cometa-and-debugging.mdx) supports displaying Solidity generated code
* Cometa can now also pinpoint the exact function (in addition to the exact line of code) where an issue occurs
* The names and descriptions of several errors have been made clearer, simplifying debugging

### =nil; CLI changes

* The =nil; CLI can use the `rpc_endpoint` from its config for working with [**the faucet service**](../getting-started/tokens.mdx#token-faucet-service) and the Cometa service if no separate endpoints are set for either of them
* The `nil contract call-readonly` command now returns JSON-formatted output when objects are returned by a call
* The =nil; CLI can display debug logs and events emitted by smart contracts when using the `nil contract call-readonly` command
* The output of the `nil config show` command has been made more concise

### `Nil.js` changes and `smart-contracts` changes

* `Nil.js` now provides the contract factory, a Hardhat-like interface for interacting with smart contracts
* It is possible to estimate gas with `Nil.js` via the `estimateGas()` function
* `Nil.js` supports sending some `feeCredit` with external transactions, making external deployment of smart contracts more convenient
* The `SmartAccount.sol` contract includes the `simpleAsyncCall()` function that can forward any `feeCredit` sent with an external transaction

## Migration of smart contracts

* Use `simpleAsyncCall()` inside `SmartAccount.sol`

Previously, the smart account contract in `SmartAccount.sol` did not forward `feeCredit` from any external transactions that were sent to it. As a result, the smart account used its balance to pay for the execution of smart contracts across async call chains. This made managing `feeCredit` complicated when interacting with other smart contracts.

`simpleAsyncCall()` resolves this issue: the smart account will use Nil.`FORWARD_REMAINING` to send its own remaining `feeCredit` across the async call chain. Note that the smart account has one additional overload of `simpleAsyncCall()` that accepts the `feeCredit` argument and uses `Nil.FORWARD_NONE`. This overload is functionally equivalent to the previous `asyncCall()` function used by the smart account.

Using the new default smart account requires redeploying it in any existing projects built on =nil;.

:::info

Inside `SmartAccount.sol`, the `asyncCall()` function and its overloads has been removed.

## Migration of =nil; CLI commands

* Use `rpc_endpoint` across all services including faucet and Cometa

It is now not necessary to set separate values for `rpc_endpoint`, `cometa_endpoint`, and `faucet_endpoint` in the config file for the =nil; CLI. If `cometa_endpoint` and `faucet_endpoint` are empty, =nil; CLI will simply send requests to the RPC endpoint, and these services should still work correctly.

* Parse improved output of the `nil contract call-readonly` command

When an object is returned as part of a call, the =nil; CLI can now show JSON-formatted output that demonstrates each object field and value:

```json
Success, result:
(address,string,string,string,string,string,string,string): {"owner": ADDRESS,"profile_name":"Jack Smith","affiliation":"bigco","bio":"bio","role":"engineer","twitter_link":"twitter","linkedin_link":"linkedin","github_link":"github"}
```

In addition, the CLI now shows logs and events emitted by smart contracts when performing calls.

* View concise contents of the =nil; CLI config file

The `nil config show` command now outputs the contents of the CLI config file without any excessive logs:

```bash
The config file   : path/to/config.ini
private_key       : PRIVATE_KEY
address           : ADDRESS
rpc_endpoint      : RPC_ENDPOINT
```

As a result, the output of the command should be easier to parse in scripts.

## Migration of `Nil.js` scripts

* Use the new contract factory

Nil.js now exposes a Hardhat-like interface for interacting with smart contracts. After being deployed, a contract can be acquired by calling the `getContract()` function:

```ts showLineNumbers
const contract = getContract({
        client: client,
        abi: ABI,
        address: ADDRESS,
        smartAccount: smartAccount,
      });
```

Afterward, simply call methods on the contract object directly instead of sending external transactions or internal transactions via a smart account:

```ts showLineNumbers
const res = await contract.read.funcName([]);
const hash = await contract.write.otherFuncName([]);
await waitTillCompleted(client, hash);
```

The contract factory provides an abstraction over common methods for interacting with already deployed contracts. Using it should make Nil.js code more concise and easy-to-read.

* Estimate gas in `Nil.js`

The `PublicClient` inside `Nil.js` now contains the `estimateGas()` function that can be used to estimate the `feeCredit` for performing a call or sending a transaction to a specific address. There is no longer a need to evaluate `feeCredit` manually or by using the =nil; CLI.

* Send `feeCredit` with an external transaction

It is now also possible to specify the exact amount of `feeCredit` send with an external transaction. Previously, this value was hard-coded. This change provides greater control over how much tokens contracts pay for their execution when called externally. 

## Migration of Hardhat projects

No specific changes have to be made to existing Hardhat projects.
