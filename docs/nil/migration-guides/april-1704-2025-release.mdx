# Release 17.04.2025: migration guide

This release of =nil; improves the output of several =nil; CLI commands and makes minor adjustments to types in `Nil.js`. It also provides several quality-of-life improvements to the Cometa service and the =nil; wallet extension.

## Summary of key changes

### General changes

* The =nil; repository now uses PNPM instead of NPM, which improves the speed and stability of package management across all JS/TS projects in the repo. 
* The =nil; wallet extension now allows for showing the private key associated with the currently active smart account.
* The =nil; Playground can now import Solidity smart contracts from NPM packages.
* The =nil; interactive tutorials now cache previously submitted solutions for completed tutorials. A cached solution is loaded automatically when a completed tutorial is opened.
* It is now possible to specify the new `solcStandardJson` key inside the JSON task passed to the Cometa service:

```json
{
  "contractName": "Test.sol:Foo",
  "compilerVersion": "0.8.28",
  "solcStandardJson": {
    "language": "Solidity",
    "sources": {
      "Test.sol": {
        "content": "// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >= 0.8.17;\ncontract Foo { constructor() payable {}\n function bar() public pure returns (uint) { return 42; } }\n"
      },
      "TestLib.sol": {
        "content": "// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >= 0.8.17;\ncontract Bar { constructor() {}\n function foo() public pure returns (uint) { return 43; } }\n"
      }
    },
...
```

* Several UI adjustments were made to the =nil; block explorer, the Playground and interactive tutorials.
* It is now possible to specify custom RPC URLs (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`) inside the =nil; Playground. This change allows for using the Playground with a locally run cluster or a cluster deployed on another custom host.
* The `AWAIT_CALL` precompile has been removed

### `smart-contracts` package changes

* The `awaitCall()` method has been removed from the `Nil.sol` contract
* The `sendTransaction()` method has been removed from the `Nil.sol` contract
* The `send()` method has been removed from the `SmartAccount.sol` contract

### =nil; CLI changes

* The output of the `nil debug` command now includes additional fields:
  - `FeeCredit`
  - `MaxFee`
  - `GasPrice`
  - `PriorityFee`

* The `--log-level` flag is now persistent for the `nil debug` command. 
* The `nil contract` command now also returns the contract hash and the contract storage root hash.

### `Nil.js` changes

* The `SmartAccount.sendTransaction()` method now returns an instance of the `Transaction` class instead of the transaction hash. 
* An object of the `Transaction` class can now call the `waitTillCompleted()` method to await the transaction results.
* The `CometaClient.compileContract()` and `CometaClient.registerContract()` methods now can accept an object representing the Cometa JSON input.
* The `CometaClient` class now supports three new methods:
  - `CometaClient.getAbi()`
  - `CometaClient.getSourceCode()`
  - `CometaClient.decodeTransactionCallData()`  

## Migration of smart contracts

* Refactor and re-deploy contracts using the `Nil.awaitCall()`, `Nil.sendTransaction()` and the `SmartAccount.send()` methods.

=nil; no longer supports awaiting the results of an async call. As a result, any smart contract using the `Nil.awaitCall()` method needs to be refactored and re-deployed. The same should be done for any contracts using the `Nil.sendTransaction()` and the `SmartAccount.send()` methods.

## Migration of =nil; CLI commands

* Remove repeated usages of the `--log-level` flag for the `nil debug` command.

As this flag has been made persistent, there is no need to specify it with every repeated usage of the `nil debug` command.

## Migration of `Nil.js` scripts

* Adjust existing usages of the `SmartAccount.sendTransaction()` method.

This method now returns a `Transaction` object rather than a transaction hash. In addition, the `waitTillCompleted()` method can now be called directly from a `Transaction` object:

```ts showLineNumbers
const tx = await wallet.sendTransaction({...});
await tx.waitTillCompleted();
```

## Migration of Hardhat projects

No specific changes have to be made to existing Hardhat projects.
