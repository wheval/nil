# Release 20.11.2024: migration guide

This release of =nil; adds several major improvements to the ease of use of developer tools, most notably the =nil; CLI and `Nil.js`. Transaction hashes and receipt hashes now follow the same format as addresses: they always begin with a byte sequence that contains the shard ID of the shard where they originated.

Creating new Hardhat projects with the =nil; Hardhat plugin is easier than ever with the addition of a special 'plugin generator'. In addition, the Hardhat plugin can source environmental variables from an existing =nil; CLI config file, removing the need for managing two separate config/`.env` files.

## Summary of key changes

### General changes and Nil.sol changes

* The first four bytes in a transaction hash or a receipt hash always point to the shard where the transaction/receipt was spawned
* In `Nil.sol`, deployment of smart contracts has been moved to the new `asyncDeploy()` function
* The `--shard-id` flag and the `shardId` param have been removed from several =nil; CLI commands and `Nil.js` functions. These developer tools are now able to correctly determine the shard from which block/transaction/receipt data should be retrieved.

### =nil; CLI changes

* The =nil; CLI supports `bytes32` as a possible CMD argument
* The =nil; CLI allows for setting the endpoint of the faucet service in its config file
* The =nil; CLI can retrieve the `seqno` of the smart account set in the config file or any other smart contract

### `Nil.js` and Hardhat changes

* The =nil; Hardhat plugin comes with a project generator that can initialize a new project in a matter of seconds
* The Hardhat plugin can now source key information (e.g., the user's smart account address) from the =nil; CLI config file
* The Hardhat plugin is now integrated with [**the Cometa service**](../guides/cometa-and-debugging.mdx)

## Migration of smart contracts

* Use `asyncDeploy()` to deploy smart contracts

`Nil.sol` now includes `asyncDeploy()` which acts as a dedicated function for deploying smart contracts. Previously, async deployments had to be handled via the `asyncCall()` function which created several issues, most notably an excessive number of overloads for `asyncCall()`. The addition of `asyncDeploy()` separates concerns and makes Solidity code cleaner and more reusable.

This also means that the `deploy` argument has been removed from all remaining overloads of `asyncCall()`.

## Migration of =nil; CLI commands

* Provide `bytes32` arguments to the =nil; CLI

When deploying or calling smart contracts, the =nil; CLI can now correctly process arguments of type `bytes32`.

* Set the endpoint of the faucet service in the =nil; CLI config

[**The faucet service**](../getting-started/essentials/tokens.mdx#token-faucet-service) is a tool for quickly 'topping up' contracts using either the default token or pre-set 'mock' tokens. To configure it via the =nil; CLI:

```bash
nil config set faucet_endpoint FAUCET_ENDPOINT
```

* Remove the `--shard-id` flag from several commands

Commands such as `nil transaction HASH` or `nil receipt HASH` no longer require providing the `--shard-id` flag. Instead, the =nil; CLI is able to determine the shard where a transaction/receipt originated and acquire its data automatically.

* Retrieve contract seqnos

To retrieve the `seqno` of the smart account specified in the =nil; CLI config file:

```bash
nil smart-account seqno
```

To retrieve the `seqno` of another smart contract:

```bash
nil contract seqno ADDRESS
```

## Migration of `Nil.js` scripts

* Remove the `shardId` argument from several functions

Similarly to the =nil; CLI, `Nil.js` has removed the `shardId` argument from several functions that retrieve block/transaction/receipt data. In addition, this argument has been removed from the `waitTillCompleted()` function whose new signature is as follows:

```ts showLineNumbers
waitTillCompleted(client, hash);
```

## Migration of Hardhat scripts

* Use the project generator to create new projects

It is now possible to create ready-made =nil; Hardhat projects without having to use the `nil-hardhat-example` repository. To install the project generator:

```bash
npm i @nilfoundation/create-nil-hardhat-project -g
```

To initialize a new project:

```bash
create-nil-hardhat-template
```

* Source environmental variables from the =nil; CLI config

Instead of managing several separate config files, any project using the =nil; Hardhat plugin can now be 'linked' to the =nil; CLI config file. To do so, add the following line inside the project `.env` file:

```
NIL_CONFIG_INI: path/to/config.ini
```

Afterward, the project should begin using the same private key and smart account as the ones used by the =nil; CLI. Whenever the =nil; CLI changes the smart account address or the private key, the project will be updated automatically. Alternatively, run `hardhat smart account update` to update the smart account manually.

Two new tasks were added to manage smart accounts using the Hardhat plugin. To create a new smart account:

```bash
smart-account update
```

To see the smart account details:

```bash
smart-account info
```

* Integrate the Cometa service with the Hardhat plugin

Two new tasks were added to integrate the Hardhat plugin with the Cometa service.

To register a contract inside Cometa:

```bash
cometa register --contract CONTRACT_NAME --address ADDRESS
```

To see the Cometa meta-data for the contract at the given address:

```bash
cometa info --address ADDRESS
```
