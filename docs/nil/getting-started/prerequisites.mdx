# Prerequisites

This page details the steps that need to be completed before working with =nil;.

## Dependencies

Prior to working with =nil;, it is recommended to install the following:

* Node.js > 18.0.0
* NPM
* Git
* Hardhat

This will allow for using the entire set of the developer tools provided with =nil; such as the =nil; client library.

To install Node.js and NPM via NVM:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
nvm install 20
npm install -g npm
```

To install Git:

```bash
apt-get install git
```

To install Hardhat:

<Tabs groupId='packageSystem'>
  <TabItem value='npm' label='npm'>
    ```bash
    npm install hardhat
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value='yarn' label='yarn'>
    ```bash
    yarn add hardhat
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Smart contracts package

The [**`@nilfoundation/smart-contracts` NPM package**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nilfoundation/smart-contracts) contains the source code of all extension libraries and various Solidity contracts used inside =nil; (such as the basic smart account contract).

<Tabs groupId='packageSystem'>
  <TabItem value='npm' label='npm'>
    ```bash
    npm -g install @nilfoundation/smart-contracts
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value='yarn' label='yarn'>
    ```bash
    yarn global add @nilfoundation/smart-contracts
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

[**Follow this explanation**](../core-concepts/shards-parallel-execution.mdx#async-execution) to learn more about the theory behind async execution, or [**complete this tutorial**](essentials/handling-async-execution.mdx) on handling async calls.

## JSON-RPC API

=nil; exposes a JSON-RPC API that supports several methods from regular Ethereum as well as some methods that are unique to the cluster.

Apart from the usual means of interacting with a JSON-RPC API (e.g., by sending CURL requests), the documentation portal provides an [**interactive API reference**](../reference/client/index.mdx).

To use it, follow the link above, select a method, input the API endpoint in the form and fill the method parameters. Click on '**Send Request**' to send the request.

:::info

The documentation portal will also generate a valid CURL script depending on the request params. This script can be used in CI pipelines or bash scripts.

:::

## =nil; CLI

The =nil; CLI is an easy-to-use tool for interacting with the cluster from any shell: it supports all major operations and can be integrated into a CI/CD pipeline.

The CLI is distributed as a standalone binary. To install it:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/NilFoundation/nil_cli/raw/master/install.sh | bash
```

Initial setup is required for the =nil; CLI to be able to interact with the cluster. [**Learn more about configuring the =nil; CLI.**](tools/nil-cli/usage.mdx)

[**The 'Reference' section**](reference/cli-reference/abi/index.mdx) contains a full list of commands that can be used via the =nil; CLI.

:::info

When using the =nil; CLI, it is possible to switch between verbose and quiet outputs using the `--quiet | -q` and `--verbose | -v` flags. This documentation uses verbose outputs throughout.

:::

## Client library

The =nil; client library is a JavaScript module that allows for interating with the cluster using JS classes and functions.

The library can be installed similarly to any other module.


<Tabs groupId='packageSystem'>
  <TabItem value='npm' label='npm'>
    ```bash
    npm install @nilfoundation/niljs
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value='yarn' label='yarn'>
    ```bash
    yarn add @nilfoundation/niljs
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Afterward, import the necessary functions and classes from the library:

```js
import { ... } from "@nilfoundation/niljs";
```

:::tip[Addresses]

When working with `Nil.js`, make sure that all hardcoded addresses are in lowercase. If an address is generated by `Nil.js`, there is no need to perform additional modifications on it.

:::

[**The 'Reference' section**](reference/client/index.mdx) contains descriptions of all essential classes and functions.

## Block explorer

The =nil; block explorer is a web app that tracks statistics about blocks, accounts, and transactions. 

:::info

Information in the block explorer may update with a slight delay compared to the current state of the cluster.

:::

[**Access the =nil; block explorer**](https://explore.nil.foundation/) and [**learn about its usage**](tools/block-explorer/usage.mdx).
